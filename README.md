## Tech stack

Building components

- 📚 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for UI component development and [auto-generated docs](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a)
- ⚛️ [React](https://reactjs.org/) declarative component-centric UI

Maintaining the system

- 📦 [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for [packaging and distribution](https://blog.hichroma.com/how-packaging-makes-it-dead-simple-to-share-ui-components-29912593539d)

## Why

melkia-ds holds UI components into a central, well-maintained repository. It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again. This simplifies building UI's with Storybook's design patterns.
